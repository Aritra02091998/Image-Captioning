# Image-Captioning
Image captioning is a task where we are provided with an image and our task is to generate a text description of the image.

Here we have used conventional architectures like CNN based ResNet50 and LSTM for caption generations. Also we have used SOTA transformer based models like Vit and GPT2 for text generation.

In some cases we picked out ready maded models from the Huggingface model Hub like BLIP-Image-Captioner of Salesforce.
